## Front-end team OKR (Objectives Key Results)

Each person’s objectives and key results are tracked in a Trello board based on a [reusable template](https://trello.com/b/URsGqKMe/person-s-okr-template).

To start using it,

1. Create a new board with Trello's "Copy Board" feature, under the whole organisation.
2. Create new cards by using the "Copy Card" feature on each template card.
3. Set your objectives as labels (use neutral colors, teal - green - blue - purple)
4. Create cards for each key results of each goal.
5. Add relevant Members to the cards so we support you achieving your key results.

The basic board structure is very simple. If you feel the need to change it, go for it.

### Defining objectives and key results

The basics, totally stolen from [re:Work - Guide: Set goals with OKRs](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/):

- Objectives are ambitious and may feel somewhat uncomfortable
- Key results are measurable and should be easy to grade with a number (from 0 to 1.0)
- OKRs are public so that everyone in the organization can see what others are working on
- The “sweet spot” for an OKR grade is 60% – 70%; if someone consistently fully attains their objectives, their OKRs aren’t ambitious enough and they need to think bigger
- Low grades should be viewed as data to help refine the next OKRs
- OKRs are not synonymous with employee evaluations
- OKRs are not a shared to-do list

## Front-end code reviews

The front-end team frequently collaborates on their different projects, formally and informally. This collaboration can happen through pair programming and code reviews, among other practices.

### Why we do code reviews

- Improve the overall quality of the work.
- Enforce and propagate our standards of quality, best practices, and coding styles.
- Spread the responsibility and knowledge for any given piece of work.
- Be beneficial for both reviewee and reviewer – in varying proportions depending on the purpose of the review.

### Doing a code review

When presenting code for review, or reviewing a given piece of code, follow those guidelines:

- Keep the review concise. Ideally, the code under review should fit on one's screen.
- Think about the bigger picture.
- Concentrate on the intention rather than the syntax – if there are stylistic issues, suggest using a linter.
- Reviews do not need to focus on the negative - if a piece of code is good, it is worth stating as well.
